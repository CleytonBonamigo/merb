merb-freezer
============

This plugin lets you freeze Merb and run it using the frozen gems. 

==Why would you want to freeze Merb?

* You might have multiple applications on the same server/slice/cluster. Different applications might require different versions of Merb. 

* You might work with a team of developers and want everyone to be using the same Merb version.

* You are using Merb Edge, you want to make sure the production server and your co workers are developing/testing against the same revision.


==What are your options?

* You just want to lock your app to a specific version. For instance version merb-core 0.9.2

* You only want to use frozen gems located in /framework or /gems


== How to lock your app?

== How to use frozen gems

Instead of starting merb by typing "merb" in your console, type "frozen-merb" and that's it :)
If frozen-merb can't find frozen gems in /framework or /gems then Merb will start normally using the system's gems.

== How to freeze your gems?

In your init.rb file, require this plugin.

   require 'merb-freezer'

You now get a new set of rake tasks:

rake freeze:core            # Freeze core from git://github.com/wycats/merb...
rake freeze:more            # Freeze more from git://github.com/wycats/merb...
rake freeze:plugins         # Freeze plugins from git://github.com/wycats/m...
